# Insights from Python Analysis
Objective
The analysis aims to understand the impact of demographic factors such as age and location on user engagement by examining the total orders and unique sessions from different age groups and locations. Additionally, user behavior, popular dishes, and their relationships with engagement metrics were explored to guide marketing and operational strategies.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Key Findings
1. Relationship Between Cooking Sessions and User Orders
The analysis highlights the relationship between cooking sessions, orders, ratings, and spending for individual users.
•	Total Orders Per User:
o	Users show a varying number of orders.
o	For example, User U001 placed 3 orders, the highest among users listed.
o	Users like U007 and U008 placed only 1 order each.


•	Total Sessions Per User:
o	The number of unique cooking sessions also varies.
o	Users U001 and U002 participated in 3 cooking sessions each.
o	Some users, such as U005 and U008, had only 1 cooking session.


•	Average Session Rating:
o	Users generally rated their cooking sessions positively, with an average rating between 4.0 and 5.0.
o	User U007 rated their session the highest with a perfect 5.0.


•	Total Amount Spent Per User:
o	Spending varies across users:
	U001 spent the most at $35.0.
	Users like U004 and U008 spent significantly less, at $8.5 and $11.0 respectively.

Insights:
•	Users with more sessions and orders tend to have higher total spending (e.g., U001 and U002).
•	Positive session ratings (4.0 and above) are consistent across all users, indicating satisfaction with the cooking sessions.
•	There appears to be a potential correlation between the number of sessions, orders, and total spending, which could be explored further to increase user engagement.

# 2. Analysis of Popular Dishes
This section highlights the top dishes ordered by users.
•	Top 5 Most Popular Dishes:
o	Spaghetti: The most popular dish, ordered 4 times.
o	Grilled Chicken: Ordered 3 times.
o	Caesar Salad: Ordered 3 times.
o	Pancakes: Ordered 2 times.
o	Oatmeal: Ordered 1 time.

# Insights:
•	Spaghetti stands out as the top favorite among users.
•	Grilled Chicken and Caesar Salad are tied as the second most popular dishes.
•	Oatmeal, while present in the top five, is the least popular with only one order.
Implications:
•	Highlighting popular dishes like Spaghetti in promotional campaigns could drive engagement.
•	Consider exploring reasons for lower popularity of dishes like Oatmeal.



# 3. Demographic Factors That Influence User Behavior
The data was grouped by location to evaluate user engagement.
•	Total Orders by Location: The total number of orders placed in each city.
•	Total Sessions by Location: The count of unique sessions initiated from each city.


Results:
•	Top Performing Locations:
o	Cities such as Los Angeles and New York exhibit the highest orders and sessions, making them key markets for the business.
•	Low Performing Locations:
o	Cities like Austin, Boston, and Miami show lower engagement, with minimal orders and sessions.

# Implications:
•	Allocate more resources and marketing efforts to high-performing cities like Los Angeles and New York to maximize returns.
•	Investigate the reasons for low engagement in cities like Austin and Boston to identify opportunities for growth.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# Conclusion
This demographic analysis highlights actionable insights:
1.	Age: Focus on the 27 and 35 age groups for targeted campaigns.
2.	Location: Prioritize investments and campaigns in Los Angeles and New York while exploring growth strategies for underperforming regions.
3.	User Behavior: Users with higher orders and sessions (e.g., U001 and U002) tend to spend more. Maintaining high session satisfaction (4.0+ ratings) is critical for retaining user engagement.
4.	Popular Dishes: Promote top-performing dishes like Spaghetti, Grilled Chicken, and Caesar Salad to encourage user participation and orders.
